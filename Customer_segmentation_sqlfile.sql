-- Step 1: Reset the database environment
-- Drop the existing database to start fresh and create a new one.
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sales_db;
CREATE DATABASE sales_db;

-- Verify initial data by displaying sample rows
SELECT * FROM sales_data_sample_project LIMIT 10;

-- Step 2: Calculate total sales in the dataset
-- Helps understand overall sales volume.
SELECT SUM(SALES) AS total_sales 
FROM sales_data_sample_project;
-- Expected output: total sales value (e.g., 10,032,628)

-- Step 3: Identify the top 5 customers by total sales
-- Useful for targeting key customers or VIP programs.
SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, SUM(SALES) AS total_sales

-- Step 4: Analyze monthly sales trends
-- Helps identify seasonal patterns or peak months.
SELECT MONTH_ID, SUM(SALES) AS monthly_sales

-- Step 5: Sales by product line
-- Understand which product lines contribute most to revenue.

-- Step 6: Inspect distinct values for key categorical columns

-- Check months for year 2003 similarly

-- Step 8: Revenue by product line (detailed revenue analysis)
SELECT PRODUCTLINE, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE

-- Step 9: Revenue by year
-- Understand revenue trends over years.
SELECT YEAR_ID, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE

-- Step 10: Revenue by deal size
-- Helps analyze sales based on deal categories (Small, Medium, Large).
SELECT DEALSIZE, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE 
FROM sales_data_sample_project

ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;

-- Step 11: Top countries by revenue
-- Identify geographical hotspots for sales.
SELECT COUNTRY, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE

-- Step 12: Top cities in the USA by revenue
-- Drills down into important cities within a major market.
SELECT CITY, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE
FROM sales_data_sample_project
WHERE COUNTRY = 'USA'
GROUP BY CITY
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;

-- Step 13: Top products in the USA by year and product line
-- Product-level analysis in the USA market.
SELECT COUNTRY, YEAR_ID, PRODUCTLINE, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE
FROM sales_data_sample_project
WHERE COUNTRY = 'USA'
GROUP BY COUNTRY, YEAR_ID, PRODUCTLINE
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;

-- Step 14: Best month for sales in a selected year (2004 example)
-- Identify peak months for targeted marketing or inventory planning.
SELECT MONTH_ID, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE, COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS FREQUENCY 
FROM sales_data_sample_project
WHERE YEAR_ID = 2004 -- Modify year as needed (e.g., 2003, 2005)
GROUP BY MONTH_ID
ORDER BY REVENUE DESC;

-- Step 15: Products sold in November of a given year (2003 example)
-- Analyze sales and orders during a specific month.
SELECT MONTH_ID, PRODUCTLINE, SUM(SALES) AS REVENUE, COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS No_Orders 
FROM sales_data_sample_project
WHERE MONTH_ID = 11 AND YEAR_ID = 2003 -- Modify year as needed
