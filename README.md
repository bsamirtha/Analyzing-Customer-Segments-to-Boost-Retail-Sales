# Analyzing-Customer-Segments-to-Boost-Retail-Sales


## Project Overview

In this project, I explored a retail sales dataset to understand customer behavior and product sales patterns. Using **SQL**, I performed **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers based on their past purchase behavior. The results were visualized through a dynamic sales dashboard created in **Power BI**. This helped uncover valuable insights that guided business solutions aimed at improving customer retention and increasing sales.

## Tools Used

* **SQL**: Data extraction, segmentation, and product grouping
* **Power BI** & **Tableau**: Dashboard creation and visualization

## Methodology

* Applied **RFM analysis** to classify customers into segments such as Lost, New, Loyal, Potential Churner, etc.
* Grouped products frequently bought together to identify cross-selling opportunities.

## Business Solutions Proposed

### Customer Segmentation-Based Strategies:



**Customer Segmentation Strategies:**

* **Lost Customers:** Reach out to understand churn reasons; offer relocation support.
* **Slipping Away:** Provide targeted discounts; enable digital payments and delivery.
* **New Customers:** Reward loyalty points; collect feedback.
* **Potential Churners:** Send personalized offers and coupons; ask for feedback.
* **Active Customers:** Offer credit billing; provide discounts on small-quantity items.
* **Loyal Customers:** Maintain regular contact; offer personalized products and flexible delivery.

**Product Grouping Strategies:**

* Create combo offers for frequently bought-together products.
* Send automated purchase reminders.
* Provide knowledgeable sales support in bundled product areas.
* Place related products near each other and billing counters.
* Suggest alternative brands as options.
